# Getting Started
* JDK 11 LTS
* If using Eclipse the pom.xml will resolve neo4j libraries.
* install docker, e.g. on MacOS:  https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
* `docker pull neo4j:4.1.1`    (or your version)
* You will need to set IDE to use JUnit 5 if 4 is its default.
* TODO apoc library and 4.1.1 is possible but no docker container...
